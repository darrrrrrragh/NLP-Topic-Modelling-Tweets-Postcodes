# NLP - Topic Modelling Tweets by London Postcodes

This repo holds Python code used to topic mine geo-tagged Twitter data collected during 2017 by the [Popertee](https://popertee.com) Data Team. The aim of the modelling was to uncover interests and trends per London postcode and use this information for targeted advertising by pop-up stores.

This was built as part of a Data Scientist internship at Popertee based on the [Topic Modelling with Scikit-Learn](https://medium.com/mlreview/topic-modeling-with-scikit-learn-e80d33668730) tutorial, specifically using both the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithms.
